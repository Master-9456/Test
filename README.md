# Hello World

-> *(This is just an example article taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"Hello,_World!"_program))* <-

A **"Hello, World!"** program is a computer program that outputs or displays `Hello, World!` to a user. Being a very ~~primitive~~ simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program. It is often the very first program people write when they are new to a language.

>The phrase is also used by computer hackers as a proof of concept that arbitrary code can be executed through an exploit where the system designers did not intend code to be executed.

### Purpose

A "Hello, World!" program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language. "Hello, world!" is also traditionally used in a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.

!!! info Time to Hello World
	TTHW is the time it takes to author a "Hello, World!" program in a given programming language. This is one measure of a programming language's ease-of-use.

### History

While small test programs have existed since the development of programmable computers, the tradition of using the phrase `"Hello, world!"` as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal book *[The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)*.

### Examples

There are many variations on the punctuation and casing of the phrase. Variations include the presence or absence of the comma and exclamation mark, and the capitalization of the 'H', both the 'H' and the 'W', or neither. 

##### 1974 C version

The example program from that book prints `hello, world` (without capital letters or exclamation mark), and was inherited from a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by *Brian Kernighan, Programming in C.A Tutorial*:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main( )
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

##### 1972 B version

The C version was preceded by Kernighan's own 1972 *A Tutorial Introduction to the [Language B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language))*, where the first known version of the program is found in an example used to illustrate external variables:

```c
main(){
  extrn a,b,c;
  putchar(a); putchar(b); putchar(c); putchar("!*n");
  }

a "hell";
b "o, w";
c "orld";
```

##### Modern languages

For modern languages, hello, world programs vary in sophistication. 

Language | What demonstrated
--- | ---
Go   | Multilingual "Hello, world"
Java |  "Hello, world" based on scalable vector graphics
XL    | A spinning Earth "Hello, world" using 3D graphics
Perl, Python, Ruby |"Hello, world" as a single statement
